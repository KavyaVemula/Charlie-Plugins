# Charlie-Plugins
This project implements 4 plugins- advisor plugin, server-side plugin, sidebet plugin and a Logan plugin. 
The advisor is a plugin that runs on the client side. Charlie consults the advisor, if one is installed and enabled, prior to each play on behalf of the user. 
Server side plugin implements two bots that act as Computer Bots. 
Side bet plugin implements side bet which is an optional bet in addition to the required, main bet which the player makes before the game starts. 
Logan is a client-side bot which plays and bets on “autopilot”, that is, without human player input
